# Aoede

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Intro

### Why Aoede name

**Geeky stuff now**

Aoede, according to Greek mythology, she was the daughter of Zeus, the King of the Gods, and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory.

She was the muse of voice and song. Since this is a blog(ish) demo, why not give it a codename that fits.
