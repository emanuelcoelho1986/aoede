# Day 3 of development

- Keep on working in `cypress` branch
- Update the pipeline to:
    - Use a decent flow: Build -> Tests -> Deploy
- Write down this `logs`
    - Prepare folder
    - Write Log from Day 1 and Day 3 (need to remember and check what I did on day 2)
- Update Readme.md
- Create a Makefile to ease my development (personal choice)
- Add ignore run into pipeline if we add a keywork to the commit `skip ci` in the commit message
