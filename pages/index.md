# About

This pages folder if more like a *diary* of things I'm doing and the description of the objectives

## Objectives

- Blog feed should list all posts and associated title, author, date and description, sorted by publish date from newest first
- Users can view individual blog posts in a separate page
- Users can view comments for a blog post
- Users can add a comment to a blog post
- Form validation


With the following in mind:

- Two or more distinct components demonstrating component hierarchy
- At least one service that interfaces with the REST API
- At least one unit test per component
- The use of a CSS pre-processing tool like SCSS/LESS
- Consideration of semantic markup, SEO and accessibility


## Adding my objectives

- Use Github Actions to build, test (unit and integration)
- Use Github Actions to deployt to firebase on Pull Request
    - We can we go for staging and production releases

- Use an external E2E/Integration tool to write tests
- Use Jest instead of Karma (due to the possibility of adding concurrent tests running)
- Use Pull request Strategy
    - Secure pull requests. This means the following:
        - At leas 1 review
        - Only Merge if all actions pass
        - Only verified commits are allowed
        - No Master direct commirts
